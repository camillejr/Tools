# Standard Atmosphere Calculator

Calculator of temperature, pressure and density at a user-specified altitude for the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

The interactive web version of the [**`Standard Atmosphere Calculator`**](https://kamilazdybal.github.io/standard-atmosphere-calculator/standard-atmosphere-calculator.html) in Python!

**Credits**

> The idea for creating this calculator was born while watching the course *Introduction to Aeronautical Engineering* by TU Delft. In the course, the equations for pressure, density and temperature for the International Standard Atmosphere were derived. In order to help me solve course problems faster I created this Standard Atmosphere Calculator.

> The interactive Python site was created following the [tutorial](http://www.tonysaad.net/code/convert-interactive-jupyter-notebook-into-a-website/) by Professor Tony Saad from the University of Utah.
